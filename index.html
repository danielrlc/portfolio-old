    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I've been learning frontend web development since August 2014, using a variety of complementary approaches. I've built the various projects listed here, studied with a mentor, and worked my way through several online courses and books. By continuously tweaking and refining my learning tools, strategy and resources, I've become a fast and effective learner.</p>
    <p>I have a background in language training and live in Finland with my wife and two young daughters.</p>

  <h2><a name="john-williams-quiz">John Williams quiz</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://ibdan.github.io/john-williams-quiz/" target="_blank">Live quiz</a></br><a href="https://github.com/ibdan/john-williams-quiz" target="_blank">Source code</a></p>
  <p>I made this short quiz as simple and interactive as possible. Wrong answers turn red, sound an ominous gong and trigger feedback, which changes for each wrong answer. The right answer turns green and sounds a "ta-da" fanfare (which you might find a tiny bit irritating after a while).</p>
  <p>The quiz demonstrates my improving frontend skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, usability and design. The site has responsive images, and the quiz content is injected via JavaScript. I created a prototype object from which all the question objects were created.</p>
  <p>I am getting better at making colours work together and using white space effectively. I used <a href="http://paletton.com" target="_blank">Paletton.com</a> to help me choose a suitable blue, green and red colour palette to work with.</p>
  
  <h2><a name="miten-menee">Miten menee?</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://mitenmenee.com" target="_blank">Live site</a></p>
  <p>This is my oldest web project, but I placed it prominently on this page because it's very different from all my frontend projects. I learnt a great deal about WordPress while building this site. I tried out many themes and plugins, tweaked a number of them, and generally got immersed in the rich and welcoming world of WordPress.</p>
  <p>The site is by no means beautiful to look at â€“ I created it before I understood CSS properly. After trying out many themes, I finally settled on the <a href="http://quarktheme.com/" target="_blank">Quark starter theme</a>, which I made several tweaks to. I also used and improved <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/flashcard/" target="_blank">this flashcards plugin</a>, by sending some code tweaks to the plugin's creator.</p>

  <h2><a name="hot-or-cold">Hot or cold game</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://ibdan.github.io/hotOrCold/" target="_blank">Live app</a></br><a href="https://github.com/ibdan/hotOrCold" target="_blank">Source code</a></p>
  <p>The app picks a random number between 1 and 100 and you have to guess it. With each guess, you get feedback on how close you got.</p>
  <p>For this project, I was required to add interactivity to the HTML and CSS files I was presented with. As a result, I learnt a very useful skill: how to take on a project that's already been started.</p>

  <h2><a name="shopping-list">Shopping list</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://ibdan.github.io/shopping-list-interactive/" target="_blank">Live app</a></br><a href="https://github.com/ibdan/shopping-list-interactive" target="_blank">Source code</a></p>
  <p>This app shows me getting to grips with jQuery and jQuery UI. You can add shopping items, cross them out, delete them and re-arrange them. Shopping has never been such fun.</p>

  <h2><a name="wax-tracks">Wax Tracks</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://ibdan.github.io/wax-tracks/" target="_blank">Live app</a></br><a href="https://github.com/ibdan/wax-tracks" target="_blank">Source code</a></p>
  <p>This basic page shows my early efforts with CSS. I enjoyed getting the semi-circular shape of the records to overlap and move upwards when hovered over, but my rookie efforts are not the most subtle. A useful learning process for me, nonetheless!</p>

  <h2><a name="google-clone">Google clone</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://ibdan.github.io/Google-Clone/" target="_blank">Live app</a></br><a href="https://github.com/ibdan/Google-Clone" target="_blank">Source code</a></p>
  <p>My first attempt at doing something a little complicated in CSS! Google had better watch out...</p>
