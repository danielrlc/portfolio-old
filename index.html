    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I've been teaching myself frontend web development since July 2014, after my interest was piqued while creating a <a href="https://mitenmenee.com" target="_blank"> WordPress website for learning Finnish</a>. I started digging into the code and making tweaks, but of course I didn't really know what I was doing. After a while, I decided I wanted to learn how to do it properly, and so my journey into frontend web development began.
    </p>I began by taking a three-month course with <a href="https://mitenmenee.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>. I liked the course as it threw me straight into it: building projects, using Github, engaging with the community, and having weekly mentor sessions. Since completing the course, I've been fleshing out my skills by taking other online courses, reading books and listening to many hours of podcasts while travelling for my current job. By continuously tweaking and refining my learning tools, strategy and resources, I've become a fast and effective learner.
    <p>I am now looking for a job in the field. What I lack in experience, I make up for in enthusiasm and motivation. I have spent many hours a week building my skills over the last months, and can't wait to put them to good use in a new career.</p>
    <p>I have a background in language training and live in Finland with my wife and two young daughters.</p>

  <h2><a name="john-williams-quiz">John Williams quiz</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://rawreef.github.io/john-williams-quiz/" target="_blank">Live app</a></br><a href="https://github.com/rawreef/john-williams-quiz" target="_blank">Source code</a></p>
  <p>I made this short quiz as simple and interactive as possible. Wrong answers turn red, sound an ominous gong and trigger feedback, which changes for each wrong answer. The right answer turns green and sounds a "ta-da" fanfare (which you might find a tiny bit irritating after a while).</p>
  <p>The quiz demonstrates my improving frontend skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, usability and design. The site has responsive images, and the quiz content is injected via JavaScript. I created a prototype object from which all the question objects were created.</p>
  <p>I am getting better at making colours work together and using white space effectively. I used <a href="http://paletton.com" target="_blank">Paletton.com</a> to help me choose a suitable blue, green and red colour palette to work with.</p>

  <h2><a name="miten-menee">Miten menee?</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://mitenmenee.com" target="_blank">Live site</a></p>
  <p>This is my oldest web project, but I placed it prominently on this page because it's very different from all my frontend projects. I learnt a great deal about WordPress while building this site. I tried out many themes and plugins, tweaked a number of them, and generally got immersed in the rich and welcoming world of WordPress.</p>
  <p>The site is by no means beautiful to look at â€“ I created it before I understood CSS properly. After trying out many themes, I finally settled on the <a href="http://quarktheme.com/" target="_blank">Quark starter theme</a>, which I made several tweaks to. I also wrote some code that improved the usability of <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/flashcard/" target="_blank">this flashcards plugin</a>, which the plugin's author accepted.</p>

  <h2><a name="hot-or-cold">Hot or cold game</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://rawreef.github.io/hotOrCold/" target="_blank">Live app</a></br><a href="https://github.com/rawreef/hotOrCold" target="_blank">Source code</a></p>
  <p>The app picks a random number between 1 and 100 and you have to guess it. With each guess, you get feedback on how close you got.</p>
  <p>For this project, I was required to add interactivity to the HTML and CSS files I was presented with. As a result, I learnt a very useful skill: how to take on a project that's already been started.</p>

  <h2><a name="shopping-list">Shopping list</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://rawreef.github.io/shopping-list-interactive/" target="_blank">Live app</a></br><a href="https://github.com/rawreef/shopping-list-interactive" target="_blank">Source code</a></p>
  <p>This app shows me getting to grips with jQuery and jQuery UI. You can add shopping items, cross them out, delete them and re-arrange them. Shopping has never been such fun.</p>

  <h2><a name="wax-tracks">Wax Tracks</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://rawreef.github.io/wax-tracks/" target="_blank">Live app</a></br><a href="https://github.com/rawreef/wax-tracks" target="_blank">Source code</a></p>
  <p>This basic page shows my early efforts with CSS. I enjoyed getting the semi-circular shape of the records to overlap and move upwards when hovered over, but my rookie efforts are not the most subtle. A useful learning process for me, nonetheless!</p>

  <h2><a name="google-clone">Google clone</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://rawreef.github.io/Google-Clone/" target="_blank">Live app</a></br><a href="https://github.com/rawreef/Google-Clone" target="_blank">Source code</a></p>
  <p>My first attempt at doing something a little complicated in CSS! Google had better watch out...</p>
